# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms and Project Values
* Attend Scrum meetings on time and notify the group in advance if you cannot make it
* Communicate through Slack team channel and check notifications often
* Be transparent - use Slack to resolve any questions as soon as possible, and be sure to contact tutors or Professor with any relevant questions
* Meeting notes should be taken for each meeting and will be updated into the Google Drive folder
* Complete tasks on time -- if you feel the workload is a lot, let the team know during the meeting

### Daily Standups
* Daily Standup meetings are held three times a week
* Current Schedule: Mondays (11:30am-11:45am), Wednesdays (11:30am-11:45am) and Fridays (9:45am-10:00am)

### Definition of "done"
* A functioning app where a guest/registered user collaboratively makes travel plans with other invited users and receives personalized recommendations for activities, hotels, flights, etc. based on personal preferences.

## Git workflow
We will be using a simplified version of the [workflow described here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
* The `master` branch at `origin` will only contain finalized code that is suitable for deployment and release
* There is a `develop` branch that exists parallel to the `master` where the `HEAD` always reflects a state with the latest changes
* Each feature will have its own branch and are branched from the `develop` branch
* Do not merge anything into `main` without full group agreement and testing the `deploy` branch
* Commit changes locally, and make sure to pull all changes before committing


## Rules for Contributing
* Each commit should have a commit message explaining what change was made. Contributors should commit to each unit of change.
* If you're stuck and need help or advice, need someone to review your work, or want to add a change, use a pull request. This helps everyone keep track of these requests and approve to merge, and the original project will not be modified.


## Resolving Disagreements  
Disagreements and conflicts should be resolved independently and as soon as possible, and team members are always welcome to share their opinions and concerns with each other. The aim for every resolution should be a situation where all parties are satisfied and reach a consensus — and this does mean that everyone should be open and willing to converse and objectively strategize to reach such an outcome. If there are any unresolved disagreements, team members can talk to tutors, graders, or Professor.
